    "| **Hypothesis** – “Recent cold‑gas inflow sets the stellar metallicity gradient in low‑mass haloes” | • Clear, testable claim with a quantitative threshold (gradient ≥ –0.1 dex kpc⁻¹ for high inflow). <br>• Physically motivated: fresh, metal‑poor gas deposited at large radii can flatten or invert gradients. <br>• Focuses on a regime (M ≈ 10¹⁰ M⊙, z ≈ 0) where RAMSES resolution is adequate. | • The hypothesis hinges on an *instantaneous* inflow estimate from a single snapshot; this should be explicitly framed as an approximation. <br>• “Cold” threshold (T < 10⁴ K) is reasonable but could be refined (e.g., T < 2 × 10⁴ K) depending on the simulation’s cooling floor. <br>• The gradient threshold (–0.1 dex kpc⁻¹) is expressed in dex kpc⁻¹ while the fit is performed in dex dex⁻¹; ensure consistent units when evaluating the claim. |\n",
    "| **Plot idea** – Two‑panel figure (metallicity profile + cold‑gas inflow) | • Directly visualises both sides of the hypothesis in a single figure. <br>• Uses only the available gas and star files, so it is feasible on a laptop. <br>• The left panel provides the measured gradient; the right panel supplies the inflow rate (with a clear annotation of the shell radius). | • The right panel currently shows a step‑function; a more informative alternative is a radial profile of the *inward* mass flux (Σ m vᵣ / Δr) as a function of radius, which would illustrate whether the inflow is truly concentrated near 0.2 R₍vir₎. <br>• Error bars on the metallicity points (e.g., bootstrap uncertainties) would help assess the robustness of the fitted slope. <br>• The plot does not display the “median inflow rate” of a sample (required for the hypothesis test). Since only one halo is available, you could compute the halo’s own median inflow over a set of concentric shells and annotate the comparison. |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Suggested minor refinements (no extra code needed)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unit consistency** – Convert the fitted slope from dex dex⁻¹ to dex kpc⁻¹ by dividing by the logarithmic derivative of radius (d log r / d r = 1 / (r ln 10)). Then you can directly compare to the –0.1 dex kpc⁻¹ threshold.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inflow metric** – Instead of a single instantaneous flux, compute the *mass‑weighted* inward radial velocity of cold gas in the shell and report the resulting inflow rate in M⊙ yr⁻¹. This is already done, but add a comment in the plot caption that it approximates the average over the last ≈200 Myr.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Plot aesthetics** – Add a small inset in the right panel showing the distribution of cold‑inflowing gas velocities (histogram) to demonstrate that the inflow is indeed dominated by negative velocities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Documentation** – Include a short “Assumptions” block at the top of the script (virial radius, temperature cut, shell thickness) so that future users can adapt it quickly to other haloes.  \n",

    "**Final recommendation**\n",

    "The hypothesis and its associated two‑panel plot are well‑matched to the available MEGATRON data (single halo, gas + star files).

      "                    Abstract: The Phononic Casimir effect between planar objects is investigated by deriving a formalism from the quantum partition function of the system following multiscattering approach. This fluctuation-induced coupling is mediated by phonons modeled as an effective elastic medium. We find that excitations with three types of polarizations arise from the resolved boundary conditions, however the coupling is dominated by only one of these degrees of freedom due to exponential suppression effects in the other two. The obtained scaling laws and dependence on materials properties and temperature suggest effective pathways of interaction control. Scenarios of materials combinations are envisioned where the Phononic Casimir effect is of similar order as the standard Casimir interaction mediated by electromagnetic fluctuations.\n",

      "                    Abstract: Decision trees and random forest remain highly competitive for classification on medium-sized, standard datasets due to their robustness, minimal preprocessing requirements, and interpretability. However, a single tree suffers from high estimation variance, while large ensembles reduce this variance at the cost of substantial computational overhead and diminished interpretability. In this paper, we propose Decision Tree Embedding (DTE), a fast and effective method that leverages the leaf partitions of a trained classification tree to construct an interpretable feature representation. By using the sample means within each leaf region as anchor points, DTE maps inputs into an embedding space defined by the tree's partition structure, effectively circumventing the high variance inherent in decision-tree splitting rules. We further introduce an ensemble extension based on additional bootstrap trees, and pair the resulting embedding with linear discriminant analysis for classification. We establish several population-level theoretical properties of DTE, including its preservation of conditional density under mild conditions and a characterization of the resulting classification error. Empirical studies on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that DTE strikes a strong balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, outperforming or matching random forest and shallow neural networks while requiring only a fraction of their training time in most cases. Overall, the proposed DTE method can be viewed either as a scalable decision tree classifier that improves upon standard split rules, or as a neural network model whose weights are learned from tree-derived anchor points, achieving an intriguing integration of both paradigms.\n",

      "                    Title: Empirical Assessment of the Perception of Software Product Line Engineering by an SME before Migrating its Code Base\n",
      "                    Abstract: Migrating a set of software variants into a software product line (SPL) is an expensive and potentially challenging endeavor. Indeed, SPL engineering can significantly impact a company's development process and often requires changes to established developer practices. The work presented in this paper stems from a collaboration with a Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) that decided to migrate its existing code base into an SPL. In this study, we conducted an in-depth evaluation of the company's current development processes and practices, as well as the anticipated benefits and risks associated with the migration. Key stakeholders involved in software development participated in this evaluation to provide insight into their perceptions of the migration and their potential resistance to change. This paper describes the design of the interviews conducted with these stakeholders and presents an analysis of the results. Among the qualitative findings, we observed that all participants, regardless of their role in the development process, identified benefits of the migration relevant to their own activities. Furthermore, our results suggest that an effective risk mitigation strategy involves keeping stakeholders informed and engaged throughout the process, preserving as many good practices as possible, and actively involving them in the migration to ensure a smooth transition and minimize potential challenges.\n",

      "                    Title: Measuring and Rating Socioeconomic Disparities among Provinces: A Case of Turkiye\n",
      "                    Abstract: Regional disparities in the economic and social structures of countries have a great impact on their development levels. In geographically, culturally and economically diverse countries like Turkiye, determining the socioeconomic status of the provinces and regional differences is an important step for planning and implementing effective policies. Therefore, this study aims to determine the socioeconomic disparities of the provinces in Turkiye. For this purpose, a socioeconomic development index covering the economic and social dimensions of 81 provinces was constructed. For the index, 16 different indicators representing economic and social factors were used. These indicators were converted into indices using the Min-Max normalization method and Principal Component Analysis. Afterwards, using these indices, the provinces were divided into groups using the K-Means clustering algorithm and the Elbow method. In the last part of the study, the results are presented in a visual format using Scatter Plots, clustering maps and QGIS mapping tools. The results of the study show that 2 of the 81 provinces in Turkiye have very high, 30 high, 25 medium and 24 low socioeconomic indices. Istanbul and Ankara have very high socioeconomic status. In general, the provinces in western Turkiye have a high socioeconomic index, while the provinces in eastern and southeastern Anatolia face serious challenges in terms of socioeconomic indicators.\n",

      "                    Abstract: Motivated by recent breakthrough studies of wave hyperbolicity in extremely anisotropic natural materials and artificial composites, we investigate the radiation pattern of a localized emitter in a hyperbolic medium. Since the emission of a point source is associated with the Fourier transform of the iso-frequency contours of a medium, we derive and analyze the properties of the Fourier transform of hyperbolic dispersion, which sheds light into the emission properties in the presence of hyperbolic bands. Our analysis leads to a generalized form of Huygens' principle for hyperbolic waves, connecting to the emergence of negative refraction and focusing with hyperbolic media. We also highlight the occurrence of aliasing artifacts in polariton imaging. More broadly, our findings provide analytical tools to model polariton propagation in materials with extreme anisotropy, and may be applied to several other physical platforms featuring hyperbolic responses, from astrophysics to seismology.\n",

      "                    Title: Azimuthal Anisotropy of Magnetic Fields in the Circumgalactic Medium Driven by Galactic Feedback Processes\n",
      "                    Abstract: We use the TNG50 cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulation of the IllustrisTNG project to show that magnetic fields in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) have significant angular structure. This azimuthal anisotropy at fixed distance is driven by galactic feedback processes that launch strong outflows into the halo, preferentially along the minor axes of galaxies. These feedback-driven outflows entrain strong magnetic fields from the interstellar medium, dragging fields originally amplified by small-scale dynamos into the CGM. At the virial radius, $z=0$ galaxies with M$_\\star \\sim 10^{10}\\,\\rm{M_\\odot}$ show the strongest anisotropy ($\\sim 0.35$ dex). This signal weakens with decreasing impact parameter, and is also present but weaker for lower mass as well as higher mass galaxies. Creating mock Faraday rotation measure (RM) sightlines through the simulated volume, we find that the angular RM trend is qualitatively consistent with recent observational measurements. We show that rich structure is present in the circumgalactic magnetic fields of galaxies. However, TNG50 predicts small RM amplitudes in the CGM that make detection difficult as a result of other contributions along the line of sight.\n",

      "                    Abstract: These are exciting times for studies of galaxy formation and the growth of structures. New observatories and advanced simulations are revolutionising our understanding of the cycling of matter into, through, and out of galaxies. This chapter first describes why baryons are essential for galaxy evolution, providing a key test of Lambda-Cold Dark Matter cosmological model. In particular, we describe a basic framework to convert measurements of the gas properties observed in absorption spectra into global estimates of the condensed (stars and cold gas) matter mass densities. We then review our current understanding of the cycling of baryons from global to galactic scales, in the so-called circumgalactic medium. The final sections are dedicated to future prospects, identifying new techniques and up-coming facilities as well as key open questions. This chapter is complemented with a series of hands-on exercises which provide a practical guide to using publicly available hydrodynamical cosmological simulations. Beyond providing a direct connection between new observations and advanced simulations, these exercises give the reader the necessary tools to make use of these theoretical models to address their own science questions. Ultimately, our increasingly accurate description of the circumgalactic medium reveals its crucial role in transforming the pristine early Universe into the rich and diverse Universe of the present day.\n",

      "                    Title: Dust in the Circumgalactic Medium of Low-Redshift Galaxies\n",
      "                    Abstract: Using spectroscopically selected galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey we present a detection of reddening due to dust in the circumgalactic medium of galaxies. We detect the mean change in the colors of \"standard crayons\" correlated with the presence of foreground galaxies at z ~0.05 as a function of angular separation. Following Peek & Graves (2010), we create standard crayons using passively evolving galaxies corrected for Milky Way reddening and color-redshift trends, leading to a sample with as little as 2% scatter in color. We devise methods to ameliorate possible systematic effects related to the estimation of colors, and we find an excess reddening induced by foreground galaxies at a level ranging from 10 to 0.5 millimagnitudes on scales ranging from 30 kpc to 1 Mpc. We attribute this effect to a large-scale distribution of dust around galaxies similar to the findings of Menard et al. 2010. We find that circumgalactic reddening is a weak function of stellar mass over the range $6 \\times 10^9 M_\\odot$ -- $6 \\times 10^{10} M_\\odot$ and note that this behavior appears to be consistent with recent results on the distribution of metals in the gas phase.\n",

      "                    Abstract: The effect of environment on the circumgalactic medium (CGM) is investigated through a comparison of Lya absorption line data in the Virgo Cluster and the field. This Letter uses the first systematic survey of background QSOs in and around the Virgo Cluster and large existing surveys of galaxies at low redshift. While previous studies found denser gas (higher equivalent width) closer to a galaxy (lower impact parameter), this correlation disappears in the Virgo environment. In addition, the covering fraction of the CGM is lower in the cluster environment than in the circumcluster environment and field. The results indicate that the CGM is suppressed for cluster galaxies while galaxies in the circumcluster environment have abundant CGM. The truncation of the CGM may result in the quenching of star formation through starvation. Our results also show that CGM surveys must consider the role of environment.\n",

Despite very different star formation properties of the galaxies considered in these separate studies and different intergalactic radiation fields at redshifts between z~2.2 and z~0, I show that both the spatial extent and mean absorption equivalent width of the CGM around galaxies of comparable mass have changed little over this cosmic time interval.\n",
