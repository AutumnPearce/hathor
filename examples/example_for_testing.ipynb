Originally defined about 80 years ago, their historical membership lists have been superseded thanks to the precise astrometry from ESA's \\textit{Gaia}'s satellite. Recent studies have however been mostly focused on individual OB associations or limited by the coverage of spectroscopic surveys. In this paper, we exploit a complete census of $\\sim$25,000 O- and B-type stars within 1 kpc of the Sun to produce a highly-reliable catalogue of 57 OB associations using the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm, increasing the number of known OB associations by a factor of two within this volume. We assess the validity of this catalogue by crossmatching our OB association members with other catalogues of OB associations, star clusters and young stellar groups, confirming the high-confidence of our census of OB associations. We characterize these OB associations physically (total initial stellar mass, number of OB stars, ...) and kinematically (velocity dispersion, linear expansion ages, ...). Nearly three quarters of the OB associations (41 out of 57) exhibit a significant expansion pattern in at least one direction, including 13 in both plane-of-the-sky directions, though differences in expansion velocity suggest anisotropical expansion patterns. We compare the locations of these OB associations with superclouds and features in the local Milky Way such as the Radcliffe Wave and discuss the implications for star formation in the solar neighbourhood.\n",

      "                            Abstract: The luminosity of embedded protostars is commonly measured via observations of the dust continuum spectral energy distribution from millimetre to infrared wavelengths. However, this method cannot be applied to embedded protostars in binary or multiple systems, where their components are usually unresolved over this extended wavelength range. We propose a new method, based on the idea that a molecule formed (mainly) on the grain surfaces only emits lines in the region where it thermally sublimates from the grain mantles, heated by the photons emitted by the embedded source. In this respect, carbonyl sulfide (OCS) is an optimal molecule, because of its low binding energy and rotational lines in the millimetre. We apply the method to the protobinary system NGC1333 IRAS4A, using ALMA high-spatial resolution ($\\sim$50 au) observations of the OCS(19-18) line as part of the ALMA Large Program FAUST. We also present new quantum mechanics calculations of the OCS binding energy distribution, essential for the application of the method. We found that the two binary components, A1 and A2, have a comparable luminosity within the error bars, 7.5$\\pm$2.5 and 7$\\pm$1 L$_\\odot$, respectively. We discuss the reliability of the estimated luminosities and the potential of this new method for measuring the luminosity of embedded protostars in binary and multiple systems.\n",

In our first paper [1], we demonstrated the system's transition from non-chaotic to chaotic dynamics by analyzing Poincaré sections, orbital evolution, and Lyapunov exponents across different energies and dark matter halo parameters. In this work, we compute the gravitational waveforms of the small celestial object along different chaotic and non-chaotic orbits by implementing the numerical kludge scheme. We further perform a spectral analysis of the gravitational waveforms from such orbits. In particular, we show that when the system is in a chaotic state, the gravitational wave signals are characterized by broader frequency spectra with finite widths, enhanced amplitude and energy emission rate, distinctly differentiating them from the signals generated during the system's non-chaotic state. Through recurrence analysis we also show that the time series of gravitational waveforms strain carry unique information on the motion of chaotic dynamics, which can be used to distinctly differentiate from non-chaotic to chaotic motion of the source. Furthermore, we discuss the potential detectability of these orbits for upcoming observatories like LISA, TianQin, and Taiji, emphasizing the significant potential for detecting chaotic imprints in gravitational waves to substantially enhance our understanding of chaotic dynamics in black hole physics and the dark matter environments of galactic nuclei.\n",

Our dataset comprises 670 distinct member stars, with a total of more than 2,000 observations collected over approximately one year. We constrain the binary fraction for UMi to be $0.61^{+0.16}_{-0.20}$ and $0.69^{+0.19}_{-0.17}$, with the binary orbital parameter distributions based on solar neighborhood observation from Duquennoy \\& Mayor (1991) and Moe \\& Di Stefano (2017), respectively. Furthermore, by dividing our data into two subsamples at the median metallicity, we identify that the binary fraction for the metal-rich ([Fe/H]>-2.14) population is slightly higher than that of the metal-poor ([Fe/H]<-2.14) population. Based on the Moe \\& Di Stefano model, the best-constrained binary fractions for metal-rich and metal-poor populations in UMi are $0.86^{+0.14}_{-0.24}$ and $0.48^{+0.26}_{-0.19}$, respectively. After a thorough examination, we find that this offset cannot be attributed to sample selection effects. We also divide our data into two subsamples according to their projected radius to the center of UMi, and find that the more centrally concentrated population in a denser environment has a lower binary fraction of $0.33^{+0.30}_{-0.20}$, compared with $1.00^{+0.00}_{-0.32}$ for the subsample in more outskirts.\n",

      "                            Abstract: A fundamental property of molecular clouds is that they are turbulent, but how this turbulence is generated and maintained is unknown. One possibility is that stars forming within the cloud regenerate turbulence via their outflows, winds and radiation (\"feedback\"). Disentangling motions created by feedback from the initial cloud turbulence is challenging, however. Here we confront the relationship between stellar feedback and turbulence by identifying and separating the local and global impact of stellar winds. We analyze magnetohydrodyanamic simulations in which we track wind material as it interacts with the ambient cloud. By distinguishing between launched material, gas entrained by the wind and pristine gas we show energy is transferred away from the sources via magnetic waves excited by the expanding wind shells. This action at a distance enhances the fraction of stirring motion compared to compressing motion and produces a flatter velocity power spectrum. We conclude stellar feedback accounts for significant energy transfer within molecular clouds, an impact enhanced by magnetic waves, which have previously been neglected by observations. Altogether, stellar feedback can partially offset global turbulence dissipation.\n",

      "                            Abstract: All molecular clouds are observed to be turbulent, but the origin, means of sustenance, and evolution of the turbulence remain debated. One possibility is that stellar feedback injects enough energy into the cloud to drive observed motions on parsec scales. Recent numerical studies of molecular clouds have found that feedback from stars, such as protostellar outflows and winds, injects energy and impacts turbulence. We expand upon these studies by analyzing magnetohydrodynamic simulations of molecular clouds, including stellar winds, with a range of stellar mass-loss rates and magnetic field strengths. We generate synthetic $^{12}$CO(1-0) maps assuming that the simulations are at the distance of the nearby Perseus molecular cloud. By comparing the outputs from different initial conditions and evolutionary times, we identify differences in the synthetic observations and characterize these using common astrostatistics. We quantify the different statistical responses using a variety of metrics proposed in the literature. We find that multiple astrostatistics, including principal component analysis, the spectral correlation function and the velocity coordinate spectrum, are sensitive to changes in stellar mass-loss rates and/or time evolution. A few statistics, including the Cramer statistic and velocity coordinate spectrum, are sensitive to the magnetic field strength. These findings demonstrate that stellar feedback influences molecular cloud turbulence and can be identified and quantified observationally using such statistics.\n",

      "                            Abstract: Stellar feedback is often cited as the biggest uncertainty in galaxy formation models today. This uncertainty stems from a dearth of observational constraints as well as the great dynamic range between the small scales (<1 pc) where the feedback occurs and the large scales of galaxies (>1 kpc) that are shaped by this feedback. To bridge this divide, in this paper we aim to assess observationally the role of stellar feedback at the intermediate scales of HII regions. In particular, we employ multiwavelength data to examine several stellar feedback mechanisms in a sample of 32 HII regions in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC, respectively). Using optical, infrared, radio, and X-ray images, we measure the pressures exerted on the shells from the direct stellar radiation, the dust-processed radiation, the warm ionized gas, and the hot X-ray emitting gas. We find that the warm ionized gas dominates over the other terms in all of the sources, although two have comparable dust-processed radiation pressures to their warm gas pressures. The hot gas pressures are comparatively weak, while the direct radiation pressures are 1-2 orders of magnitude below the other terms. We discuss the implications of these results, particularly highlighting evidence for hot gas leakage from the HII shells and regarding the momentum deposition from the dust-processed radiation to the warm gas. Furthermore, we emphasize that similar observational work should be done on very young HII regions to test whether direct radiation pressure and hot gas can drive the dynamics at early times.\n",

      "                            Abstract: Stars embedded in the inner pc region of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) experience extreme accretion conditions that significantly alter their evolution. We present one-dimensional MESA simulations of stars growing and decaying within AGN disks, implementing radiative-feedback-regulated accretion which limits stellar growth near the Eddington luminosity, as well as wind-driven mass loss. Unlike stand-alone stars in the field, these embedded stars follow unique evolutionary tracks with well-determined mass evolution and chemical yields. We distinguish two regimes: ``immortal\" stars that indefinitely remain on the main sequence due to efficient hydrogen mixing; and ``metamorphic\" stars that evolves off the main sequence, ultimately enriching the disk with heavy elements upon hydrogen and helium exhaustion in their cores. Results indicate that embedded stars in AGN disks can attain large masses, but gas retention and limited mixing likely render the ``immortal\" track unsustainable. We show radiative feedback plays a critical role in preventing runaway growth, since it regulates the inflow to at most of order-unity the Eddington-limited mass-loss rate. Embedded metamorphic stars significantly enrich AGN disks with helium and $α$-elements, potentially explaining the observed high metallicity in broad-line regions (BLR) without excessive helium enrichment. This study underscores the critical interplay between stellar feedback and accretion physics in shaping the stellar populations and chemical evolution within AGN disks.\n",

Based on the Moe \\& Di Stefano model, the best-constrained binary fractions for metal-rich and metal-poor populations in UMi are $0.86^{+0.14}_{-0.24}$ and $0.48^{+0.26}_{-0.19}$, respectively. After a thorough examination, we find that this offset cannot be attributed to sample selection effects. We also divide our data into two subsamples according to their projected radius to the center of UMi, and find that the more centrally concentrated population in a denser environment has a lower binary fraction of $0.33^{+0.30}_{-0.20}$, compared with $1.00^{+0.00}_{-0.32}$ for the subsample in more outskirts.\n",

      "                            Title: Turbulent Action at a Distance due to Stellar Feedback in Magnetized Clouds\n",
      "                            Abstract: A fundamental property of molecular clouds is that they are turbulent, but how this turbulence is generated and maintained is unknown. One possibility is that stars forming within the cloud regenerate turbulence via their outflows, winds and radiation (\"feedback\"). Disentangling motions created by feedback from the initial cloud turbulence is challenging, however. Here we confront the relationship between stellar feedback and turbulence by identifying and separating the local and global impact of stellar winds. We analyze magnetohydrodyanamic simulations in which we track wind material as it interacts with the ambient cloud. By distinguishing between launched material, gas entrained by the wind and pristine gas we show energy is transferred away from the sources via magnetic waves excited by the expanding wind shells. This action at a distance enhances the fraction of stirring motion compared to compressing motion and produces a flatter velocity power spectrum. We conclude stellar feedback accounts for significant energy transfer within molecular clouds, an impact enhanced by magnetic waves, which have previously been neglected by observations. Altogether, stellar feedback can partially offset global turbulence dissipation.\n",

      "                            Title: An Exploration of the Statistical Signatures of Stellar Feedback\n",
      "                            Abstract: All molecular clouds are observed to be turbulent, but the origin, means of sustenance, and evolution of the turbulence remain debated. One possibility is that stellar feedback injects enough energy into the cloud to drive observed motions on parsec scales. Recent numerical studies of molecular clouds have found that feedback from stars, such as protostellar outflows and winds, injects energy and impacts turbulence. We expand upon these studies by analyzing magnetohydrodynamic simulations of molecular clouds, including stellar winds, with a range of stellar mass-loss rates and magnetic field strengths. We generate synthetic $^{12}$CO(1-0) maps assuming that the simulations are at the distance of the nearby Perseus molecular cloud. By comparing the outputs from different initial conditions and evolutionary times, we identify differences in the synthetic observations and characterize these using common astrostatistics. We quantify the different statistical responses using a variety of metrics proposed in the literature. We find that multiple astrostatistics, including principal component analysis, the spectral correlation function and the velocity coordinate spectrum, are sensitive to changes in stellar mass-loss rates and/or time evolution. A few statistics, including the Cramer statistic and velocity coordinate spectrum, are sensitive to the magnetic field strength. These findings demonstrate that stellar feedback influences molecular cloud turbulence and can be identified and quantified observationally using such statistics.\n",

      "                            Title: The Role of Stellar Feedback in the Dynamics of HII Regions\n",
      "                            Abstract: Stellar feedback is often cited as the biggest uncertainty in galaxy formation models today. This uncertainty stems from a dearth of observational constraints as well as the great dynamic range between the small scales (<1 pc) where the feedback occurs and the large scales of galaxies (>1 kpc) that are shaped by this feedback. To bridge this divide, in this paper we aim to assess observationally the role of stellar feedback at the intermediate scales of HII regions. In particular, we employ multiwavelength data to examine several stellar feedback mechanisms in a sample of 32 HII regions in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC, respectively). Using optical, infrared, radio, and X-ray images, we measure the pressures exerted on the shells from the direct stellar radiation, the dust-processed radiation, the warm ionized gas, and the hot X-ray emitting gas. We find that the warm ionized gas dominates over the other terms in all of the sources, although two have comparable dust-processed radiation pressures to their warm gas pressures. The hot gas pressures are comparatively weak, while the direct radiation pressures are 1-2 orders of magnitude below the other terms. We discuss the implications of these results, particularly highlighting evidence for hot gas leakage from the HII shells and regarding the momentum deposition from the dust-processed radiation to the warm gas. Furthermore, we emphasize that similar observational work should be done on very young HII regions to test whether direct radiation pressure and hot gas can drive the dynamics at early times.\n",

      "                            Abstract: Stars embedded in the inner pc region of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) experience extreme accretion conditions that significantly alter their evolution. We present one-dimensional MESA simulations of stars growing and decaying within AGN disks, implementing radiative-feedback-regulated accretion which limits stellar growth near the Eddington luminosity, as well as wind-driven mass loss. Unlike stand-alone stars in the field, these embedded stars follow unique evolutionary tracks with well-determined mass evolution and chemical yields. We distinguish two regimes: ``immortal\" stars that indefinitely remain on the main sequence due to efficient hydrogen mixing; and ``metamorphic\" stars that evolves off the main sequence, ultimately enriching the disk with heavy elements upon hydrogen and helium exhaustion in their cores. Results indicate that embedded stars in AGN disks can attain large masses, but gas retention and limited mixing likely render the ``immortal\" track unsustainable. We show radiative feedback plays a critical role in preventing runaway growth, since it regulates the inflow to at most of order-unity the Eddington-limited mass-loss rate. Embedded metamorphic stars significantly enrich AGN disks with helium and $α$-elements, potentially explaining the observed high metallicity in broad-line regions (BLR) without excessive helium enrichment. This study underscores the critical interplay between stellar feedback and accretion physics in shaping the stellar populations and chemical evolution within AGN disks.\n",
