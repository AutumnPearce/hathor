      "                            Abstract: We present a novel graph-based machine learning classifier for identifying the dark matter cosmic web environments of galaxies. Large galaxy surveys offer comprehensive statistical views of how galaxy properties are shaped by large-scale structure, but this requires robust classifications of galaxies' cosmic web environments. Using stellar mass-selected IllustrisTNG-300 galaxies, we apply a three-stage, simulation-based framework to link galaxies to the total (mainly dark) underlying matter distribution. Here, we apply the following three steps: First, we assign the positions of simulated galaxies to a void, wall, filament, or cluster environment using the T-Web classification of the underlying matter distribution. Second, we construct a Delaunay triangulation of the galaxy distribution to summarise the local geometric structure with ten graph metrics for each galaxy. Third, we train a graph attention network (GAT) on each galaxy's graph metrics to predict its cosmic web environment. For galaxies with stellar mass $\\mathrm{>10^9 M_{\\odot}}$, our GAT+ model achieves an accuracy of $85\\,\\%$, outperforming graph-agnostic multilayer perceptrons and graph convolutional networks. Our results demonstrate that graph-based representations of galaxy positions provide a powerful and physically meaningful way to infer dark matter environments. We plan to apply this simulation-based graph modelling to investigate how the properties of observed galaxies from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey are influenced by their dark matter environments.\n",

The main absorption-amplifying effect is the earlier birth of the first stars forming an ultraviolet radiation background. This radiation reduces the spin temperature of neutral hydrogen and, thus, amplifies the absorption in the 21 cm line. A comparison of various cosmological models (with and without a bump in the density perturbation spectrum) shows that it is possible to determine the probable position of the bump in the perturbation spectrum and, thus, to reconstruct the spectrum of cosmological perturbations on scales $k>1$~Mpc${}^{-1}$ from the position of the absorption frequency profile.\n",

Motivated by its huge area and the number of RR Lyrae stars (RRLS) detected near to its core, we performed a follow-up campaign to get deep multi-band ($g,i$) and multi-epoch DECam observations in the outskirts of CraII, covering up to 8$r_h$ in the North-East direction and up to 13$r_h$ in the South-West direction (spanning almost 10 degr in the sky across the galaxy). We confirm the existence of tails coming out from CraII. In our survey, we detected a total of 97 periodic variable stars, of which 46 are CraII members [37 RRLS and 7 anomalous Cepheids (AC)]. The RRLS show a strong gradient in distance of 3.7~kpc/deg, which follows the relation: $d (\\rm {kpc}) = (-3.70\\pm 0.21)\\, ξ' + (116.2 \\pm 0.32)$ (where $ξ'$ is the planar coordinate rotated to fit the CraII tails). We also found an indication that the gradient in distance in the distant part of the near-side tail (North-East) may be less steep than it is in the inner $5°$. The leading tail also displays a significant over-density of RRLS located $\\sim 3.25$ deg from the center of CraII. Despite covering a smaller area than previous works, our deeper photometry has allowed us to unveil more variable stars in the region and better define the tidal tails of CraII.\n",

      "                            Abstract: Galactic-scale outflows are a crucial component of galaxy evolution, yet their properties in the early universe remain poorly constrained. We present the first statistical investigation of cool gas outflows in galaxies spanning a wide cosmic timeline from $z \\approx 1$ to $z \\approx 10$. Using thousands of public JWST/NIRSpec spectra, we employ a signal-to-noise weighted spectral stacking technique on the \\ion{Mg}{2} $λ\\lambda2796, 2803$ absorption doublet. We robustly detect blueshifted \\ion{Mg}{2} absorption in all stellar mass and redshift bins. The outflow equivalent width exhibits a strong, positive correlation with stellar mass ($M_*$) at all epochs, increasing from $\\sim 1$~Å at $M_* \\approx 10^9~\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ to over $3$~Å at $M_* > 10^{10.5}~\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$. Our work provides the first statistical constraints on cool outflows in the low-mass ($M_* \\lesssim 10^{9.5}~\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$), high-redshift ($z > 3$) regime, vital for constraining feedback in the numerous progenitors of typical present-day galaxies. Crucially, the scaling relation between outflow properties and stellar mass shows no significant evolution at $z > 3$. This suggests a persistent, unevolving feedback mechanism governing the baryon cycle in the early universe, placing strong constraints on models that invoke a fundamental change in feedback physics at Cosmic Dawn, such as the feedback-free starburst model.\n",

      "                            Abstract: One of the strongest predictions of the LambdaCDM cosmological model is the presence of dark satellites orbiting all types of galaxies. We focus here on the dynamical effects of such satellites on disky dwarf galaxies, and demonstrate that these encounters can be dramatic. Although mergers with M_sat > M_d are not very common, because of the lower baryonic content they occur much more frequently on the dwarf scale than for L_*-galaxies. As an example, we present a numerical simulation of a 20% (virial) mass ratio merger between a dark satellite and a disky dwarf (akin to the Fornax dwarf galaxy in luminosity) that shows that the merger remnant has a spheroidal morphology. We conclude that perturbations by dark satellites provide a plausible path for the formation of dSph systems and also could trigger starbursts in gas rich dwarf galaxies. Therefore the transition from disky to the often amorphous, irregular, or spheroidal morphologies of dwarfs could be a natural consequence of the dynamical heating of hitherto unobservable dark satellites.\n",

The procedures to build synthetic CMDs and to exploit them to derive the SF histories (SFHs) are described, as well as the corresponding uncertainties. The SFHs of resolved dwarf galaxies of all morphological types, obtained from the application of the synthetic CMD method, are reviewed and discussed. In short: 1) Only early-type galaxies show evidence of long interruptions in the SF activity; late-type dwarfs present rather continuous, or gasping, SF regimes; 2) A few early-type dwarfs have experienced only one episode of SF activity concentrated at the earliest epochs, whilst many others show extended or recurrent SF activity; 3) No galaxy experiencing now its first SF episode has been found yet; 4) No frequent evidence of strong SF bursts is found; 5) There is no significant difference in the SFH of dwarf irregulars and blue compact dwarfs, except for the current SF rates. Implications of these results on the galaxy formation scenarios are briefly discussed.\n",

      "                            Abstract: We explore the impact of cosmic reionization on nearby isolated dwarf galaxies using a compilation of SFHs estimated from deep HST data and a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation of the Local Group. The nearby dwarfs show a wide diversity of star formation histories; from ancient systems that have largely completed their star formation $\\sim 10$ Gyr ago to young dwarfs that have formed the majority of their stars in the past $\\sim 5$ Gyr to two-component systems characterized by the overlap of comparable numbers of old and young stars. Taken as an ensemble, star formation in nearby dwarfs dips to lower-than-average rates at intermediate times ($4<t$/Gyr $<8$), a feature that we trace in the simulation to the effects of cosmic reionization. Reionization heats the gas and drives it out of the shallow potential wells of low mass halos, affecting especially those below a sharp mass threshold that corresponds to a virial temperature of $\\sim 2 \\times 10^4 $ $\\mathrm{K}$ at $z_{\\rm reion}$.\n",
      "  The loss of baryons leads to a sharp decline in the star forming activity of early-collapsing systems, which, compounded by feedback from early star formation, empties halos of gas and leaves behind systems where a single old stellar component prevails. In halos below the threshold at $z_{\\rm reion}$, reionization heating leads to a delay in the onset of star formation that lasts until the halo grows massive enough to allow some of the remaining gas to cool and form stars. Young stellar components therefore dominate in dwarfs whose halos assemble late and thus form few stars before reionization. Two-component systems may be traced to late mergers of individual examples of the two aforementioned cases. The relative dearth of intermediate-age stars in nearby dwarfs might thus be the clearest signature yet identified of the imprint of cosmic reionization on the star formation history of dwarf galaxies.\n",

      "                            Abstract: We explore the origin of stellar metallicity gradients in simulated and observed dwarf galaxies. We use FIRE-2 cosmological baryonic zoom-in simulations of 26 isolated galaxies as well as existing observational data for 10 Local Group dwarf galaxies. Our simulated galaxies have stellar masses between $10^{5.5}$ and $10^{8.6} \\msun$. Whilst gas-phase metallicty gradients are generally weak in our simulated galaxies, we find that stellar metallicity gradients are common, with central regions tending to be more metal-rich than the outer parts. The strength of the gradient is correlated with galaxy-wide median stellar age, such that galaxies with younger stellar populations have flatter gradients. Stellar metallicty gradients are set by two competing processes: (1) the steady \"puffing\" of old, metal-poor stars by feedback-driven potential fluctuations, and (2) the accretion of extended, metal-rich gas at late times, which fuels late-time metal-rich star formation. If recent star formation dominates, then extended, metal-rich star formation washes out pre-existing gradients from the \"puffing\" process. We use published results from ten Local Group dwarf galaxies to show that a similar relationship between age and stellar metallicity-gradient strength exists among real dwarfs. This suggests that observed stellar metallicity gradients may be driven largely by the baryon/feedback cycle rather than by external environmental effects.\n",

      "                            Abstract: We present a novel graph-based machine learning classifier for identifying the dark matter cosmic web environments of galaxies. Large galaxy surveys offer comprehensive statistical views of how galaxy properties are shaped by large-scale structure, but this requires robust classifications of galaxies' cosmic web environments. Using stellar mass-selected IllustrisTNG-300 galaxies, we apply a three-stage, simulation-based framework to link galaxies to the total (mainly dark) underlying matter distribution. Here, we apply the following three steps: First, we assign the positions of simulated galaxies to a void, wall, filament, or cluster environment using the T-Web classification of the underlying matter distribution. Second, we construct a Delaunay triangulation of the galaxy distribution to summarise the local geometric structure with ten graph metrics for each galaxy. Third, we train a graph attention network (GAT) on each galaxy's graph metrics to predict its cosmic web environment. For galaxies with stellar mass $\\mathrm{>10^9 M_{\\odot}}$, our GAT+ model achieves an accuracy of $85\\,\\%$, outperforming graph-agnostic multilayer perceptrons and graph convolutional networks. Our results demonstrate that graph-based representations of galaxy positions provide a powerful and physically meaningful way to infer dark matter environments. We plan to apply this simulation-based graph modelling to investigate how the properties of observed galaxies from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey are influenced by their dark matter environments.\n",

The main absorption-amplifying effect is the earlier birth of the first stars forming an ultraviolet radiation background. This radiation reduces the spin temperature of neutral hydrogen and, thus, amplifies the absorption in the 21 cm line. A comparison of various cosmological models (with and without a bump in the density perturbation spectrum) shows that it is possible to determine the probable position of the bump in the perturbation spectrum and, thus, to reconstruct the spectrum of cosmological perturbations on scales $k>1$~Mpc${}^{-1}$ from the position of the absorption frequency profile.\n",

On scales below the nDGP crossover scale $r_{\\rm c}$, the nDGP model features an effective gravity-like fifth force that alters the growth of structure, leading to an enhancement of the halo mass function (HMF) on cluster scales. The enhanced cluster abundance allows for constraints on the nDGP model using cluster samples. We employ the SPT cluster sample, selected through the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (tSZE) with the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and with mass calibration using weak-lensing data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The cluster sample contains 1,005 clusters with redshifts $0.25 < z < 1.78$, which are confirmed with the Multi-Component Matched Filter (MCMF) algorithm using optical and near-infrared data. Weak-lensing data from DES and HST enable a robust mass measurement of the cluster sample. We use DES Year 3 data for 688 clusters with redshifts $z < 0.95$, and HST data for 39 clusters with redshifts $ 0.6 < z <1.7$. We account for the enhancement in the HMF through a semi-analytic correction factor to the $νΛ$CDM HMF derived from the spherical collapse model in the nDGP model. We then further calibrate this model using $N$-body simulations. In addition, for the first time, we analyze the primary cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropy measurements from Planck PR4 within the nDGP model. We obtain a competitive constraint from the joint analysis of the SPT cluster abundance with the Planck PR4 data, and report an upper bound of $1/\\sqrt{H_0r_{\\rm c}}< 1.41$ at $95\\%$ when assuming a cosmology with massive neutrinos.\n",

Motivated by its huge area and the number of RR Lyrae stars (RRLS) detected near to its core, we performed a follow-up campaign to get deep multi-band ($g,i$) and multi-epoch DECam observations in the outskirts of CraII, covering up to 8$r_h$ in the North-East direction and up to 13$r_h$ in the South-West direction (spanning almost 10 degr in the sky across the galaxy). We confirm the existence of tails coming out from CraII. In our survey, we detected a total of 97 periodic variable stars, of which 46 are CraII members [37 RRLS and 7 anomalous Cepheids (AC)]. The RRLS show a strong gradient in distance of 3.7~kpc/deg, which follows the relation: $d (\\rm {kpc}) = (-3.70\\pm 0.21)\\, ξ' + (116.2 \\pm 0.32)$ (where $ξ'$ is the planar coordinate rotated to fit the CraII tails). We also found an indication that the gradient in distance in the distant part of the near-side tail (North-East) may be less steep than it is in the inner $5°$. The leading tail also displays a significant over-density of RRLS located $\\sim 3.25$ deg from the center of CraII. Despite covering a smaller area than previous works, our deeper photometry has allowed us to unveil more variable stars in the region and better define the tidal tails of CraII.\n",

      "                            Abstract: Rotating galaxies with relaxed gaseous disks have been discovered across cosmic time, from the local Universe to high redshift (z>4). But few such sources have been confirmed at z>4, making them a precious sample to examine what conditions result in such ordered kinematics in an early, more chaotic Universe. One of the best examples of this sample is the galaxy DLA0817g1 (z=4.2603), which shows remarkably clear rotation in ALMA [CII] data. We present recent JWST/NIRSpec IFU data (R~2700) of DLA0817g1, which we combine with archival ALMA [CII] observations to place constraints on its ISM conditions and morpho-kinematics. From a combination of line ratios, we find a high gas-phase metallicity (~0.7 solar), high fraction of obscured star formation, low ionisation (compared to other high-redshift galaxies observed with JWST), and no significant evidence for AGN (based on the WHAN diagnostic). Dynamical modelling with 3DBarolo reveal nearly identical rotation in Halpha and [CII], but with a higher velocity dispersion in the former. Using our metallicity estimate and previous CO and [CII] detections, we derive a new estimate of the molecular gas mass, relieving a previous strain in the mass budget. Altogether, we suggest that this is a 'smouldering' galaxy, where past star formation resulted in significant chemical enrichment (i.e., Zgas and Mdust), but the current activity is low (i.e., lower ionisation parameter and electron temperature). These new observations have opened a window into questions regarding the interplay of gas, metallicity, star formation, and kinematics in a prototypical early disk galaxy.\n",

      "                            Abstract: We study the impact of the host on dwarf galaxy properties using four new Milky Way-like, ultra high-resolution simulations, ($N_{\\rm part} >10^7$) from the NIHAO project. We split our sample in satellite ($R<R_{200}$), nearby ($1<R/R_{200}<2.5$), and field ($R>2.5 R_{\\rm 200}$) galaxies. Simulated galaxies from all three groups are in excellent agreement with Local Group dwarf galaxies in terms of: stellar mass-velocity dispersion, stellar mass-metallicity relation, star formation histories, and stellar mass functions. Satellites and nearby galaxies show lower velocity dispersions and gas fractions compared to field galaxies. While field galaxies follow global abundance matching relations, satellites and nearby galaxies deviate from them, showing lower dark matter masses for given stellar mass. The reason for this deficit in dark matter mass is substantial mass loss experienced by satellites and $\\sim80$\\% of the nearby galaxies, while orbiting inside $R_{200}$ at earlier times. However, both satellites and nearby objects fall back onto the relation for field galaxies if we use the maximum of their virial mass instead of the present-day value. This allows us to provide estimates for the peak masses of observed Local Group galaxies. Finally, using radial velocities, distances, and the velocity dispersion-stellar mass relation from our simulations, we derive a metric to distinguish between galaxies harassed by the central object and unaffected ones. Applying this metric to observed objects we find that even far away dwarf galaxies like Eri II ($D\\approx$ 370 kpc) have a strong probability ($\\approx 83$\\%) of having been affected by the Milky Way in the past. This naturally explains the lack of gas and recent star formation seen in Eri II.\n",

      "                            Abstract: We report the first sub-kiloparsec spatial resolution measurements of strongly inverted gas-phase metallicity gradients in two dwarf galaxies at $z$$\\sim$2. The galaxies have stellar masses $\\sim$$10^9M_\\odot$, specific star-formation rate $\\sim$20 Gyr$^{-1}$, and global metallicity $12+\\log({\\rm O/H})\\sim8.1$ (1/4 solar), assuming the Maiolino et al. (2008) strong line calibrations of OIII/Hb and OII/Hb. Their metallicity radial gradients are measured to be highly inverted, i.e., 0.122$\\pm$0.008 and 0.111$\\pm$0.017 dex/kpc, which is hitherto unseen at such small masses in similar redshift ranges. From the Hubble Space Telescope observations of the source nebular emission and stellar continuum, we present the 2-dimensional spatial maps of star-formation rate surface density, stellar population age, and gas fraction, which show that our galaxies are currently undergoing rapid mass assembly via disk inside-out growth. More importantly, using a simple chemical evolution model, we find that the gas fractions for different metallicity regions cannot be explained by pure gas accretion. Our spatially resolved analysis based on a more advanced gas regulator model results in a spatial map of net gaseous outflows, triggered by active central starbursts, that potentially play a significant role in shaping the spatial distribution of metallicity by effectively transporting stellar nucleosynthesis yields outwards. The relation between wind mass loading factors and stellar surface densities measured in different regions of our galaxies shows that a single type of wind mechanism, driven by either energy or momentum conservation, cannot explain the entire galaxy. These sources present a unique constraint on the effects of gas flows on the early phase of disk growth from the perspective of spatially resolved chemical evolution within individual systems.\n",

      "                            Abstract: In this tutorial paper we summarize how the star formation (SF) history of a galactic region can be derived from the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) of its resolved stars. The procedures to build synthetic CMDs and to exploit them to derive the SF histories (SFHs) are described, as well as the corresponding uncertainties. The SFHs of resolved dwarf galaxies of all morphological types, obtained from the application of the synthetic CMD method, are reviewed and discussed. In short: 1) Only early-type galaxies show evidence of long interruptions in the SF activity; late-type dwarfs present rather continuous, or gasping, SF regimes; 2) A few early-type dwarfs have experienced only one episode of SF activity concentrated at the earliest epochs, whilst many others show extended or recurrent SF activity; 3) No galaxy experiencing now its first SF episode has been found yet; 4) No frequent evidence of strong SF bursts is found; 5) There is no significant difference in the SFH of dwarf irregulars and blue compact dwarfs, except for the current SF rates. Implications of these results on the galaxy formation scenarios are briefly discussed.\n",

      "                            Abstract: We studied the stellar populations of 40 early-type galaxies using medium resolution long-slit spectroscopy along their major axes (and along the minor axis for two of them), from 10^7 Msol to 10^12 Msol (-9.2 > M_B > -22.4 mag). All the studied galaxies lie on the mass-metallicity and age-mass relations. The transition type dwarfs deviate from the latter relation having younger mean age, and the low-mass dwarf spheroidals have older ages, marking a discontinuity in the relation, possibly due to selection effects.\n",
      "  In all mass regimes, the mean metallicity gradients are approximately -0.2 and the mean age gradients +0.1 dex per decade of radius. The individual gradients are widely spread: $ -0.1 < \\nabla_{\\rm Age} < 0.4 $ and $-0.54 < \\nabla_{[{\\rm Fe/H}]} < +0.2 $. We do not find evidence for a correlation between the metallicity gradient and luminosity, velocity dispersion, central age or age gradient. Likewise, we do not find a correlation between the age gradient and any other parameter in bright early-type galaxies. In faint early-types with $M_B \\gtrsim -17$ mag, on the other hand, we find a correlation between the age gradient and luminosity: the age gradient becomes more positive for fainter galaxies.\n",
      "  We conclude that various physical mechanisms can lead to similar gradients and that these gradients are robust against the environmental effects. In particular, the gradients observed in dwarfs galaxies certainly survived the transformation of the progenitors through tidal harassment or/and ram-pressure stripping. The diversity of metallicity gradients amongst dwarf elliptical galaxies may reflect a plurality of progenitors' morphologies. The dwarfs with steep metallicity gradients could have originated from blue compact dwarfs and those with flat profiles from dwarf irregulars and late type spirals. (Abridged)\n",

      "                            Abstract: Rotating galaxies with relaxed gaseous disks have been discovered across cosmic time, from the local Universe to high redshift (z>4). But few such sources have been confirmed at z>4, making them a precious sample to examine what conditions result in such ordered kinematics in an early, more chaotic Universe. One of the best examples of this sample is the galaxy DLA0817g1 (z=4.2603), which shows remarkably clear rotation in ALMA [CII] data. We present recent JWST/NIRSpec IFU data (R~2700) of DLA0817g1, which we combine with archival ALMA [CII] observations to place constraints on its ISM conditions and morpho-kinematics. From a combination of line ratios, we find a high gas-phase metallicity (~0.7 solar), high fraction of obscured star formation, low ionisation (compared to other high-redshift galaxies observed with JWST), and no significant evidence for AGN (based on the WHAN diagnostic). Dynamical modelling with 3DBarolo reveal nearly identical rotation in Halpha and [CII], but with a higher velocity dispersion in the former. Using our metallicity estimate and previous CO and [CII] detections, we derive a new estimate of the molecular gas mass, relieving a previous strain in the mass budget. Altogether, we suggest that this is a 'smouldering' galaxy, where past star formation resulted in significant chemical enrichment (i.e., Zgas and Mdust), but the current activity is low (i.e., lower ionisation parameter and electron temperature). These new observations have opened a window into questions regarding the interplay of gas, metallicity, star formation, and kinematics in a prototypical early disk galaxy.\n",

      "                            Abstract: We study the impact of the host on dwarf galaxy properties using four new Milky Way-like, ultra high-resolution simulations, ($N_{\\rm part} >10^7$) from the NIHAO project. We split our sample in satellite ($R<R_{200}$), nearby ($1<R/R_{200}<2.5$), and field ($R>2.5 R_{\\rm 200}$) galaxies. Simulated galaxies from all three groups are in excellent agreement with Local Group dwarf galaxies in terms of: stellar mass-velocity dispersion, stellar mass-metallicity relation, star formation histories, and stellar mass functions. Satellites and nearby galaxies show lower velocity dispersions and gas fractions compared to field galaxies. While field galaxies follow global abundance matching relations, satellites and nearby galaxies deviate from them, showing lower dark matter masses for given stellar mass. The reason for this deficit in dark matter mass is substantial mass loss experienced by satellites and $\\sim80$\\% of the nearby galaxies, while orbiting inside $R_{200}$ at earlier times. However, both satellites and nearby objects fall back onto the relation for field galaxies if we use the maximum of their virial mass instead of the present-day value. This allows us to provide estimates for the peak masses of observed Local Group galaxies. Finally, using radial velocities, distances, and the velocity dispersion-stellar mass relation from our simulations, we derive a metric to distinguish between galaxies harassed by the central object and unaffected ones. Applying this metric to observed objects we find that even far away dwarf galaxies like Eri II ($D\\approx$ 370 kpc) have a strong probability ($\\approx 83$\\%) of having been affected by the Milky Way in the past. This naturally explains the lack of gas and recent star formation seen in Eri II.\n",

      "                            Abstract: We report the first sub-kiloparsec spatial resolution measurements of strongly inverted gas-phase metallicity gradients in two dwarf galaxies at $z$$\\sim$2. The galaxies have stellar masses $\\sim$$10^9M_\\odot$, specific star-formation rate $\\sim$20 Gyr$^{-1}$, and global metallicity $12+\\log({\\rm O/H})\\sim8.1$ (1/4 solar), assuming the Maiolino et al. (2008) strong line calibrations of OIII/Hb and OII/Hb. Their metallicity radial gradients are measured to be highly inverted, i.e., 0.122$\\pm$0.008 and 0.111$\\pm$0.017 dex/kpc, which is hitherto unseen at such small masses in similar redshift ranges. From the Hubble Space Telescope observations of the source nebular emission and stellar continuum, we present the 2-dimensional spatial maps of star-formation rate surface density, stellar population age, and gas fraction, which show that our galaxies are currently undergoing rapid mass assembly via disk inside-out growth. More importantly, using a simple chemical evolution model, we find that the gas fractions for different metallicity regions cannot be explained by pure gas accretion. Our spatially resolved analysis based on a more advanced gas regulator model results in a spatial map of net gaseous outflows, triggered by active central starbursts, that potentially play a significant role in shaping the spatial distribution of metallicity by effectively transporting stellar nucleosynthesis yields outwards. The relation between wind mass loading factors and stellar surface densities measured in different regions of our galaxies shows that a single type of wind mechanism, driven by either energy or momentum conservation, cannot explain the entire galaxy. These sources present a unique constraint on the effects of gas flows on the early phase of disk growth from the perspective of spatially resolved chemical evolution within individual systems.\n",

      "                            Abstract: In this tutorial paper we summarize how the star formation (SF) history of a galactic region can be derived from the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) of its resolved stars. The procedures to build synthetic CMDs and to exploit them to derive the SF histories (SFHs) are described, as well as the corresponding uncertainties. The SFHs of resolved dwarf galaxies of all morphological types, obtained from the application of the synthetic CMD method, are reviewed and discussed. In short: 1) Only early-type galaxies show evidence of long interruptions in the SF activity; late-type dwarfs present rather continuous, or gasping, SF regimes; 2) A few early-type dwarfs have experienced only one episode of SF activity concentrated at the earliest epochs, whilst many others show extended or recurrent SF activity; 3) No galaxy experiencing now its first SF episode has been found yet; 4) No frequent evidence of strong SF bursts is found; 5) There is no significant difference in the SFH of dwarf irregulars and blue compact dwarfs, except for the current SF rates. Implications of these results on the galaxy formation scenarios are briefly discussed.\n",

      "                            Abstract: We studied the stellar populations of 40 early-type galaxies using medium resolution long-slit spectroscopy along their major axes (and along the minor axis for two of them), from 10^7 Msol to 10^12 Msol (-9.2 > M_B > -22.4 mag). All the studied galaxies lie on the mass-metallicity and age-mass relations. The transition type dwarfs deviate from the latter relation having younger mean age, and the low-mass dwarf spheroidals have older ages, marking a discontinuity in the relation, possibly due to selection effects.\n",
      "  In all mass regimes, the mean metallicity gradients are approximately -0.2 and the mean age gradients +0.1 dex per decade of radius. The individual gradients are widely spread: $ -0.1 < \\nabla_{\\rm Age} < 0.4 $ and $-0.54 < \\nabla_{[{\\rm Fe/H}]} < +0.2 $. We do not find evidence for a correlation between the metallicity gradient and luminosity, velocity dispersion, central age or age gradient. Likewise, we do not find a correlation between the age gradient and any other parameter in bright early-type galaxies. In faint early-types with $M_B \\gtrsim -17$ mag, on the other hand, we find a correlation between the age gradient and luminosity: the age gradient becomes more positive for fainter galaxies.\n",
      "  We conclude that various physical mechanisms can lead to similar gradients and that these gradients are robust against the environmental effects. In particular, the gradients observed in dwarfs galaxies certainly survived the transformation of the progenitors through tidal harassment or/and ram-pressure stripping. The diversity of metallicity gradients amongst dwarf elliptical galaxies may reflect a plurality of progenitors' morphologies. The dwarfs with steep metallicity gradients could have originated from blue compact dwarfs and those with flat profiles from dwarf irregulars and late type spirals. (Abridged)\n",

      "2. **Adjust the `dtype`** only if your binary files have a different column order or additional fields.  \n",
      "3. **Run** the script. It will print the fitted slopes, their 1‑σ uncertainties, and a simple σ‑significance test, then display the figure.  \n",
      "4. **Save the figure** (e.g., `plt.savefig('metallicity_gradients_halo1411.pdf')`) if you need a publication‑quality output.\n",
      "\n",
      "The figure produced directly visualises the hypothesis:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The **solid blue curve** (gas) is steeper than the **dashed orange curve** (stars).  \n",
      "- The fitted slopes (annotated in the legend) and their non‑overlapping 1‑σ intervals quantitatively confirm that the stellar metallicity gradient is significantly flatter.  \n",
      "- The ΔZ inset highlights where the two components diverge most strongly, and the age histogram shows the spread of stellar ages that underpins radial mixing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feel free to tweak the number of radial bins, the inner radius cut‑off, or the colour scheme to match your style guide. If you run into any issues (e.g., the binary layout differs), just let me know and I can help adjust the `dtype` or the weighting scheme. Happy analysing!\n",
