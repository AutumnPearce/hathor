      "*What to look for:* When the ne field is summed (or column‑averaged) along the z‑axis, the resulting 2‑D image should display a steep central excess of surface electron‑density that falls off roughly as a β‑model ( Σₑ(r) ∝ [1+(r/rₚ)²]^{–3β+0.5} ). In a genuine cool‑core cluster this central peak will be sharply confined (rₚ ≲ 100 kpc) and roughly circular, whereas a non‑cool‑core system will show a flatter core and more irregular isodensity contours. By fitting concentric annuli to the projected map and extracting a radial profile, you can test whether the core slope, core radius, and β‑parameter match the cool‑core expectations and how they vary with halo mass or redshift within the MEGATRON sample.\n",

If clumping is significant, high‑C regions will appear as bright, filamentary spikes or small isolated blobs superimposed on the smoother halo outskirts. By constructing the map of C(r) = ⟨Σₑ²⟩_θ / ⟨Σₑ⟩_θ² in concentric radial bins (θ denotes azimuthal averaging), you can test whether C rises from ≈ 1 in the inner ∼ 0.5 R₍₂₀₀₎ to ≳ 2–3 near R₍₂₀₀₎, as predicted by cosmological‑hydro simulations.

By projecting the level field (or a weighted combination, e.g., level × ne) you can expose the spatial distribution of the most refined zones. If a halo has undergone a recent major merger, the high‑level regions will trace elongated, off‑center bridges or “cold‑front”–like edges that are not concentric with the main density peak. Conversely, a relaxed halo should show a roughly circular high‑level shell surrounding the central peak. Quantify the hypothesis by measuring the azimuthal variance of the high‑level mask as a function of radius and comparing it to the variance of the projected ne map; a strong correlation (high‑level variance ≫ ne variance) would indicate merger‑driven substructure.\n",

      "| 7️⃣|**Entropy proxy**|Compute a *physically‑motivated* entropy proxy that mimics the 3‑D definition `K = kT nₑ⁻²ᐟ³`:<br> 1. Estimate an **effective projection depth** `⟨Δ⟩` for each annulus from the AMR hierarchy (average cell size within the annulus). <br> 2.

      "| 9️⃣|**Uncertainty estimation**|Three complementary error estimators (all stored for later propagation):<br> • **Poisson** on pixel counts (σ = √N). <br> • **Bootstrap** – resample the set of cells × 1000 and recompute `Cₙ, Kₚ,0`. <br> • **Jack‑knife** – drop one quadrant (NW, NE, SW, SE) of the map at a time, recompute the diagnostics, and take the spread as a systematic error. |`C_n_err`, `Kp0_err` (both **stat** + **sys**)|\n",
      "| 🔟|**Classification thresholds**|After a pilot run (≈ 50 halos) tune the thresholds that maximise the *relaxed* ↔ *merging* separation (using the merger‑tree “relaxed” flag).

      "| 1️⃣1️⃣|**Sanity‑check A – Azimuthal variance**|Rotate the fitted ellipse by ± 15° (keeping a, b fixed) and recompute `Cₙ` & `Kₚ,0`. The fractional change must be < 10 % for a relaxed halo; larger scatter flags a disturbed morphology. |`ΔCₙ_rot`, `ΔKp0_rot` |\n",
      "| 1️⃣2️⃣|**Sanity‑check B – Core‑excision test**|Mask the innermost `0.02 R₂₀₀` (set those pixels to zero) and recompute `Cₙ`. For a truly relaxed system the concentration should retain **≥ 80 %** of its original value; a merger will lose most of its signal. |`Cₙ_excision` |\n",
      "| 1️⃣3️⃣|**Resolution & projection robustness**|Run the full pipeline on a **lower‑resolution** version of the same halo (e.g. drop one AMR level) and on the **alternative LOS**.

      "| 1️⃣4️⃣|**Deliverables – Figures**|For every halo (and each projection) produce a 2‑panel plot:<br> • Left: projected Σₙₑ map (log‑norm) with the fitted ellipse over‑plotted. <br> • Right: radial profiles `Σ_ne(r)`, `Σ_T(r)`, `Kₚ(r)` (log‑log) with the annuli shown as shaded bands. <br>Additionally – a *summary scatter plot* `Cₙ` vs. `Kₚ,0` colour‑coded by merger‑tree label, and ROC curves for the chosen thresholds. |PNG / PDF files + interactive Jupyter notebook that lets the reviewer toggle projection, re‑compute the diagnostics, and overlay the ellipse. |\n",
      "| 1️⃣5️⃣|**Catalog output**|A master table (`halo_id, proj, C_n, C_n_err, Kp0, Kp0_err, relaxed_flag, pass_cut`) saved as `CSV`. Include the ellipse parameters so that downstream analyses (e.g. stacking) can re‑use the same geometry. |`coolcore_catalog.csv` |\n",
      "| 1️⃣6️⃣|**Reproducibility**|All random seeds (e.g. for bootstrap) fixed; the pipeline wrapped in a single function `run_coolcore(df, R200, ...)`.

      "| 3️⃣|**Build the **global** density‑level relation**|For the *entire* simulation (or at least the bin), compute the **median** AMR level `⟨L⟩` as a function of electron density `nₑ`. <br> ‑ Use **log‑log** bins of `nₑ` (≥ 30 cells per bin). <br> ‑ Fit a **robust spline** (`UnivariateSpline` with `s≈0.5·N`) to capture the underlying trend while suppressing outliers.

      "| 6️⃣|**Define a high‑excess mask**|Apply a *threshold* `ΔL_thr` to isolate regions where the refinement excess is significant. <br> ‑ Perform a **threshold sweep**: `ΔL_thr ∈ {0.5, 1.0, 1.5}` (in units of AMR levels). <br> ‑ For each threshold compute a **Merging Index** (see next step) and evaluate its ability to separate *merging* versus *relaxed* halos (using the merger‑tree label). <br> ‑ Choose the `ΔL_thr` that **maximises the ROC‑AUC** (store the optimal value per mass/redshift bin).|`ΔL_mask = (ΔL_map > ΔL_thr_opt)`|\n",
      "| 7️⃣|**Quadrupole moments of the mask**|Treat the high‑excess region as a 2‑D density field **weighted by ΔL** (instead of a binary mask).

For a relaxed halo the mask should be empty or consist of tiny, scattered patches. |Annotated PNGs for a few representative halos |\n",

      "3. **Parallelise**: the per‑halo loops are embarrassingly parallel – use `multiprocessing.Pool` or `joblib.Parallel` to speed up a batch of 1000 halos.\n",
      "4. **Version control**: keep the notebooks (for interactive inspection) separate from the batch scripts, but both import the same library so that the figures generated in the notebooks are guaranteed to match the catalog values.\n",
      "5. **Testing**: write a few unit tests (e.g. verify that `ΔL` is zero for a perfectly resolved, monotonic density‑level relation) and integration tests (run on a tiny test halo and check that the outputs match pre‑computed regression values).\n",
